###  where to go from here

1. Add another endangered species, and mark it as a sample pull request in the README for future contributors (both for adding it into the extension and to the landing page).
2. Add even more species and spread the words.
3. Potentially easier way for people to donate or contribute to relevant charities. (eg get extra goodie for mini pet by donating to relevant charities or sharing the extension?)
4. Support FireFox as well (if it does not already do so).
