###  where to go from here

1. Add another endangered species, and mark it as a sample pull request in the README for future contributors (both for adding it into the extension and to the landing page).
2. Add even more species and spread the words.
3. Potentially easier way for people to donate or contribute to relevant charities.
4. Support FireFox as well (if it does not already do so).
