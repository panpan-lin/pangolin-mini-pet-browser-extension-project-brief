###  other requirements

* Please set up a separate Gmail account for the project, esp. for uploading to the Chrome Web Store.
* Changes should come in in the form of a pull request, and should be reviewed by another member of the team before merging. Never merge your own pull request!
* The project has to be designed in a way where it is easy to add another speices, and potentially will end up with a lot of species, both for the extension and the website. So think before you build.
* Documentation and naming are very important as we want more people to be able to contribute.
