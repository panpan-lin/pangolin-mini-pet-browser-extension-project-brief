### what we are going to build

* A cross-browser extension that provides a pangolin as a mini pet that the users can interact with, so as to raise awareness for this critically endangered, most trafficked mammal in the world.

* A landing page to provide more information about the species.

* It needs to be designed in a way to be easily extendable to include more endangered species in the future.
