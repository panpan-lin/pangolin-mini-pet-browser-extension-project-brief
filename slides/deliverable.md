###  MVP deliverable

1. A Chrome extension hosted in Chrome Web Store that users can download and play with.
2. A public GitHub repository with a clear guidance in the README file as to how to build, test, and contribute to the project by creating pull request.
3. A simple landing page of the project, with a sub-page about pangolin (can be linked from extension) and how a user can help, including useful links to related organisations. This should have its separate public GitHub repo.
